\title{E. coli promoter gene sequences (DNA)}
\description{
  Promoters have a region where a protein (RNA polymerase) must make contact
   and the helical DNA sequence must have a valid conformation so that
   the two pieces of the contact region spatially align.
   The data contains DNA sequences of promoters and non-promoters.
 }
\usage{data(promotergene)}
\format{
  A data frame with 106 observations and 58 variables.
  The first variable \code{Class} is a factor with levels \code{+} for a promoter gene  
  and \code{-} for a non-promoter gene. 
  The remaining 57 variables \code{V2 to V58} are factors describing the sequence. 
  The DNA bases are coded as follows: \code{a} adenine \code{c} cytosine \code{g} 
  guanine \code{t} thymine
